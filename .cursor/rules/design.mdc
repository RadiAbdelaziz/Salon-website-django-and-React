Always ensure the design is fully responsive and looks elegant on all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Guidelines:

Use flex, grid, or responsive Tailwind utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) to adapt layout to screen width.

Avoid fixed pixel widths; use relative units (%, rem, vw, vh) for scalable components.

Ensure images use object-fit: cover and maintain consistent aspect ratios.

Text and buttons must remain readable and clickable on small screens.

Maintain clean visual hierarchy, generous whitespace, and clear typography (e.g. Inter, Poppins).

No overlapping, clipping, or hidden content at any breakpoint.

Use consistent padding and spacing between sections.

Stick to a minimalist, modern look similar to Apple, Airbnb, or Sephora — no visual clutter.

Check all changes in light and dark themes if applicable.

🎯 Focus on: clarity, balance, scalability, and modern polish — not decoration.
