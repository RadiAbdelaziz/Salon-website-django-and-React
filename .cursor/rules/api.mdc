Important: When improving or refactoring any design, do not modify, remove, or rename any API-related code or props.

Specifically:

Never touch useEffect, fetch, axios, or frappe.call functions.

Do not rename or delete variables, endpoints, or request payloads.

Do not move logic that sends or receives API data.

Only change UI code: HTML structure, CSS classes, Tailwind styles, or layout elements.

Keep all event handlers (e.g. onClick, onSubmit, onChange) exactly as they are.

You can wrap existing elements in new containers for layout, but the data flow must remain identical.

Any state variables or hooks used for API calls must remain untouched.

Your changes should focus only on visual design, spacing, responsiveness, and typography.
Never break or alter the existing API logic.
